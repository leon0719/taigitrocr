en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_0.jpg	PREFACE
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_1.jpg	IN 1874 I received " Lists of Chinese Characters in the Fonts
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_2.jpg	of the Presbyterian Mission Press," Shanghai. The " first
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_3.jpg	list " consists of 6,664 characters arranged. according to
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_4.jpg	radicals and strokes. All of these I wrote in a note book,
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_5.jpg	then with much labor put the name of each and its meaning
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_6.jpg	in the Romanized Colloquial alongside. The students who
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_7.jpg	were travelling with me knew quite a number of characters.
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_8.jpg	Several had been teachers for half-a-dozen years and one was
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_9.jpg	a druggist. I believed drill even in their own language would
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_10.jpg	make them more ready and accurate. Accordingly each one
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_11.jpg	made a copy for immediate use as the work progressed.
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_12.jpg	Soon the radicals became as familiar as the English alphabet
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_13.jpg	to Canadian boys. Every day 100 different characters were
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_14.jpg	written out, analyzed and committed to memory. One
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_15.jpg	thousand were repeated every night after worship. They
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_16.jpg	thus acquired such a knowledge of their written language
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_17.jpg	as Chinese teachers and graduates in North Formosa did not.
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_18.jpg	possess. One who was unable to write a letter at the time
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_19.jpg	is this day an able Chinese scholar. As time rolled on other
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_20.jpg	students made copies from my original one. Thirty such were
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_21.jpg	burnt during the French troubles. Quite a number have been
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_22.jpg	This work was neither conceived nor prepared for that purpose,
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_23.jpg	still so anxious, and as they all declare it has been of great
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_24.jpg	assistance in the past, I now comply with their request.
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_25.jpg	One of their number has carefully written a copy for the
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_26.jpg	printer and two went to Shanghai to see it through the Press.
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_27.jpg	Out of the 6,664 not a few have been omitted (because not in
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_28.jpg	general use here) and others have been added, making in all
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_29.jpg	9,45l. The latter were gathered from the Bible, Chinese
en_Qing_Dynasty2_crop_30.jpg	classics and a dictionary by Wells Williams, LL.D.,which
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_0.jpg	P. VAN DER LOON
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_1.jpg	6
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_2.jpg	setting four reals as the price at which the book could be sold.8 The full title,
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_3.jpg	as given above, is not printed inside the frame enclosing the text but in the
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_4.jpg	right-hand, or inner, margin and seems to have been added at a later stage.
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_5.jpg	The same applies to the two columns in the outer margin, which say :
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_6.jpg	"This book has not been made without authorization, but is published
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_7.jpg	with licence of the Bishop and the Governor. When we first came to Manila,
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_8.jpg	we ordered a skilled craftsman to cut these blocks. Completed in the second
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_9.jpg	month of spring in the year of our Lord 1593."
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_10.jpg	We may comment that the Bishop of Manila, Domingo de Salazar, had
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_11.jpg	left his see in June 1591 and gone to Spain. It is not clear whether the licence
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_12.jpg	was issued before his departure or by the Vicar-General afterwards. The
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_13.jpg	words "when we first came to Manila" suggest that the cutting of the blocks
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_14.jpg	was begun long before March 1593, the date when the Shih-lu was pub-
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_15.jpg	lished. This is borne out by the postface on 62a (see text figure), contrasting
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_16.jpg	with the rest of the book by the irregular number of characters in each
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_17.jpg	column (19 instead of 20) and its different inking. Moreover, the originally
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_18.jpg	single rules between the columns are duplicated and overlap, some even
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_19.jpg	crossing the characters, which means that for this page two separate blocks
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_20.jpg	were used, the impressions of which are "out of register". This postface
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_21.jpg	reads as follows:
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_22.jpg	"The word of God has been handed down for a long time, but there was
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_23.jpg	nobody who could find its essential meaning and authentic tradition. I, Juan,
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_24.jpg	a priest of this church, have transmitted the Scriptures and analysed them in
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_25.jpg	Chinese, editing several chapters which I have had cut on woodblocks in
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_26.jpg	order to increase their circulation, and hoping that those who join our faith
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_27.jpg	will thoroughly study the meaning of this book and follow the true religion,
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_28.jpg	as when the clouds have scattered and one sees the blue sky or when the
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_29.jpg	thornbush is cleared away and one follows the open road. But having only
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_30.jpg	written a few chapters without completing the rest of the work, I am now
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_31.jpg	entrusted with a political mission and shall wait till next year before I go into
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_32.jpg	further detail and compose the remainder, which I shall add to the book so as
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_34.jpg	to form the complete text of the Veritable record'. For the time being I have
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_35.jpg	written this by way of preface."
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_36.jpg	The circumstances of Cobo's mission are well known.9 He had been
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_37.jpg	appointed ambassador to Japan and left Manila at the end of June 1592.
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_38.jpg	After having been received by Hideyoshi, he set sail for home in November
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_39.jpg	of the same year, but was apparently shipwrecked and lost.
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_40.jpg	Summing up the evidence available, we find that the cutting of the blocks
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_41.jpg	Cuellar was already secretary to the Governor on 12 January 1591 : the latest
en_Post-WW2_1_crop_42.jpg	document attested by him as notary which I know of is dated 28 April 1594.

en_Post-WW2_2_crop_1.jpg	of authorship. It is most unlikely that the two parts were written by the same
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_2.jpg	person. To all appearance the Doctrina originally ended with the catechism,
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_3.jpg	exactly like the Doctrina in Spanish and Tagalog, whereas the lengthy
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_4.jpg	explanation of the rosary and the appended disciplinary rules are by another
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_5.jpg	hand. Within this second part, the act of contrition is again incongruous
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_6.jpg	and seems to have been an independent composition; related in style to the
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_7.jpg	first part.
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_8.jpg	Who were the authors? The titlepage states that the book was composed
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_9.jpg	by the Dominican priests who were working among the Sangleys but does
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_10.jpg	not give further details. Since the translation of this basic manual was one of
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_11.jpg	the first activities of missionaries to any part of the world, attention has been
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_12.jpg	concentrated on the earliest period of the Dominican mission to the Chinese,
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_13.jpg	between 1587 and 1595. The most detailed study of the problem hitherto
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_14.jpg	published concludes from the external evidence that, of the four friars coming
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_15.jpg	into consideration, Miguel de Benavides should be regarded as the original
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_16.jpg	author; that his work was corrected, perhaps substantially, by Juan Cobo;
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_17.jpg	and that the final editing was done by Domingo de Nieva and Juan Mal-
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_18.jpg	donado de San Pedro Martir.14 In studying the problem afresh we should
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_19.jpg	bear in mind the testimony offered by the text itself and examine the lin-
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_20.jpg	guistic competence of these four priests.
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_21.jpg	Miguel de Benavides, who was born in 1552 and died in 1605 as Arch-
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_22.jpg	bishop of Manila, was one of the Dominicans who arrived in Manila in 1587.
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_23.jpg	Juan Cobo came a year later and consequently for some time spoke Chinese
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_24.jpg	less well than Benavides. "Father fray Miguel was catechizing them and
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_25.jpg	preaching in their Chinese language, and made a Doctrina in their language.
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_26.jpg	I myself did not yet know the language, but the Lord has been served, so
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_27.jpg	that in a short time I had some success", as he reports on his first year in the
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_28.jpg	letter of July 1589 to friends in Mexico. The nature of the Doctrina which
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_29.jpg	Benavides had prepared is not clear, but one may strongly doubt whether,
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_30.jpg	after less than two years of study, he could have written a Chinese text
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_31.jpg	without assistance. Cobo's own progress sounds impressive. He had learned
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_32.jpg	to speak the language, but also attempted to read a number of Chinese books,
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_33.jpg	which he describes in some detail in his letter. With the help of his neigh-
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_34.jpg	bours he had even begun to translate one of these, a guidebook of China.
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_35.jpg	Trying to dispel some misconceptions about the tens of thousands of charac-
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_36.jpg	ters which bewilder the outsider, he writes: "In actual fact the ordinary signs
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_37.jpg	which they commonly use are not so difficult that they cannot be reduced to
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_38.jpg	vocabularies. These we are already making, so that the people who come after
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_39.jpg	Despite the difficulty of the characters and although the Chinese coming to
en_Post-WW2_2_crop_40.jpg	Manila were the scum of the earth, there were very few illiterates among them :

en_Post-WW2_3_crop_1.jpg	17
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_2.jpg	presence was so embarrassing for her, as the chronicler puts it - they had to
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_3.jpg	go to an open hut on the city wall, where they suffered abuse from soldiers
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_4.jpg	and were exposed to the weather, but later were given shelter in the house of a
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_5.jpg	rich sea captain who had been to Manila. After some time a charge of
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_6.jpg	espionage and bribery was brought against the two priests, and a letter was
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_7.jpg	produced in court in support of this accusation. Unable to prove their
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_8.jpg	innocence, Benavides one day on his way to the tribunal met a stranger who
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_9.jpg	advised him to ask to see the letter, so that he could plead that it was not
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_10.jpg	signed. This move was successful, but the advantage gained was nearly lost
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_11.jpg	when the court became suspicious of a petition which Benavides had sub-
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_12.jpg	mitted, as it was not believed that he could have written it himself. "Actually
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_13.jpg	he could not have done it alone if the Lord had not helped him very specially.
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_14.jpg	because although he knew some commoner characters he could not have
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_15.jpg	known the uncommon ones which were needed in such a special and unusual
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_16.jpg	transaction, let alone those required for the words and expressions which in
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_17.jpg	the higher places are used in China and with which he was not acquainted."
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_18.jpg	He insisted however that no Chinese had helped him. In order to resolve all
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_19.jpg	doubts he was ordered to write another petition on the spot. The friar did not
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_20.jpg	lose his confidence, but rather than thinking about what he should write
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_21.jpg	began slowly and with devotion to say the rosary, and when he had finished
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_22.jpg	with this promptly wrote down the petition, to the astonishment of those
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_23.jpg	present. God had helped him to do much more than what he knew by him-
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_24.jpg	self, and had also inspired him to absorb some characters which he had seen
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_25.jpg	on a note held by a boy in the street and which came in useful for the
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_26.jpg	petition. As a result Benavides and Castro were acquitted, but being
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_27.jpg	foreigners had to leave the country.20
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_28.jpg	The author of this hagiographic account is the Dominican Diego
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_29.jpg	Aduarte, who himself first arrived in Manila in 1595 and later, as pro-
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_30.jpg	curator of his province, spent many years in Spain. His book was not
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_31.jpg	published until 1640, four years after his death, but while in Spain he had
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_32.jpg	lent the unfinished manuscript to the Dominican historian Juan Lopez.
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_33.jpg	The story as told by the latter differs in some significant details, the most
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_34.jpg	important of which is that Benavides in writing the first letter had in fact
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_35.jpg	been helped by a Chinese friend.20a Was Aduarte's account embellished
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_36.jpg	afterwards? It is certainly not surprising that Benavides was unable to write
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_37.jpg	in the documentary style, but in view of the discrepancy between the two
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_38.jpg	versions one wonders whether he had reached fluency even in written
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_39.jpg	Hokkien, as used in the first. part of the Doctrina. Moreover, Bishop
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_40.jpg	Salazar says only of Cobo that he knew characters.
en_Post-WW2_3_crop_41.jpg	Having returned to Manila in March 1591, Benavides left again in June

en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_0.jpg	INTRODUCTION.
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_1.jpg	VII.
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_2.jpg	Great difficulty has been experienced in getting the proper
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_3.jpg	Chinese characters to represent all the sounds used in this book. For
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_4.jpg	some there are no characters, and accordingly for these I have had to
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_5.jpg	go far afield, and borrow as I could. In some cases this has been to-
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_6.jpg	lerably satisfactory, and in others it has been quite the reverse. In
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_7.jpg	explanation of the small rings used with the Chinese characters, I may
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_8.jpg	say, that when a is attached to one it must be read with its colloquial
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_9.jpg	character has two : it means that a character of proper sound but en-
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_10.jpg	tirely different meaning has been borrowed for the occasion.
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_11.jpg	In the preparation of this Dictionary I have been glad to take
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_12.jpg	advantage of every assistance that was possibly available. I am chiefly
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_13.jpg	indebted however to the following, viz. Rev. Dr. Douglas' Chinese
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_14.jpg	and English Dictionary of the Amoy Colloquial, Dr. Williams' Chinese
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_15.jpg	Dictionary, as well as his English and Chinese Vocabulary, Rev J.
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_16.jpg	Doolittle's Vocabulary and Hand book of the Chinese language, and an
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_17.jpg	English and Chinese Dictionray by Tam Tat Hin, I desire heartily
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_18.jpg	to acknowledge my obligations to these authors for the assistance they
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_19.jpg	have rendered to me in many ways. To Dr. Williams special thanks
en_Qing_Dynasty1_crop_20.jpg	are due, as several articles in my dictionary have been copied from his.

en_Post-WW2_4_crop_1.jpg	18
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_2.jpg	of that year to accompany Salazar to Spain. During the previous year the
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_3.jpg	mission to the Chinese had been strengthened by the appointment of two
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_4.jpg	more Dominican priests. The first was Juan Maldonado, who until shortly
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_5.jpg	before his death in 1598 devoted himself to the Chinese mission and of whom
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_6.jpg	we are told that he compensated for a bad pronunciation by acquiring a large
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_7.jpg	vocabulary.21 There is no evidence that he ever attempted to read or write
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_8.jpg	in Chinese. More important as a linguist was Domingo de Nieva, already
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_9.jpg	proficient in Tagalog before he entered upon his new duties and later very
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_10.jpg	successful in his Chinese studies, to be discussed below. It is however clear
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_11.jpg	that the dominant personality in this early period was Juan Cobo. We have
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_12.jpg	already seen that when in June 1592 he left for Japan he had for a long time
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_13.jpg	been engaged in writing the Shih-lu.
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_14.jpg	Cobo's letter, as quoted before, states that he had begun to compile
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_15.jpg	Some sort of dictionary. It is possible that this was the work mentioned by
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_16.jpg	Francisco de Montilla, a Franciscan friar who had been in the Philippines
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_17.jpg	from 1582 to 1595 and thus had known Cobo personally. In Montilla's
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_18.jpg	enigmatic, if not nonsensical, words, "Father Cobo reduced to a grammar the
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_19.jpg	way of writing in Chinese which, as it had sixty thousand different letters or
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_20.jpg	characters, was very confusing; and finally he reduced all the characters to
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_21.jpg	four categories : very general characters, general characters, specific characters,
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_22.jpg	and particular or individual characters, because for almost everything they
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_23.jpg	use, see or hear they have a different character".22 As far I know, no other
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_24.jpg	contemporary author makes mention of a grammar or dictionary by Cobo,
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_25.jpg	and such a work may never have been completed. Perhaps he took his notes
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_26.jpg	with him on his journey, in which case they must have been lost.
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_27.jpg	The historian-hagiographer Aduarte has more to say about Cobo's
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_29.jpg	Chinese language, and saw to it that they learned and recited it aloud in
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_30.jpg	church, as well as saying it in their private houses, Something which until
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_31.jpg	then had never happened and from which they have drawn great benefits;
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_32.jpg	and because he could not succeed the first time without mistakes,as it was
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_33.jpg	in such a difficult language, which he had learned in such a short time,
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_34.jpg	he went over it again and brought it to such perfection that there was
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_35.jpg	afterwards very little which the priests who followed after him had to
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_36.jpg	correct." He learned to read and write three thousand characters and
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_37.jpg	translated some Chinese books, "because they contained very profound
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_38.jpg	sayings, though written by heathens, like those of Seneca and others of that
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_39.jpg	kind among us. He taught astronomy to some of them whom he found
en_Post-WW2_4_crop_40.jpg	suited for it . . ."23
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_0.jpg	THE MANILA INCUNABULA AND EARLY HOKKIEN STUDIES
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_1.jpg	21
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_2.jpg	given in the letter of Dasmarinas. It says: "There have been printed primers
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_3.jpg	and catechisms of the faith, one in Spanish and Tagalog. which is the native
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_4.jpg	language, and the other in Chinese, which are being sent to Your Majesty,
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_5.jpg	the Tagalog priced at two reals and the Chinese at four, which it is hoped
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_6.jpg	will be of great benefit."29
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_7.jpg	One of the two books licensed by Dasmarinas is, without doubt, the
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_8.jpg	present Doctrina in Spanish and Tagalog, which we have discussed above.
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_9.jpg	The two documents disagree about its price; but the second account, giving
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_10.jpg	it as two reals, is borne out by Cuéllar's valuation in the book itself. They do
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_11.jpg	not differ about the price of the other book, the Doctrina (or "primer" or
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_12.jpg	"catechism") in Chinese, which is set at four reals. This corresponds to
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_13.jpg	Cuéllar's valuation of the Shih-lu, containing roughly twice the number of
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_14.jpg	pages of the Doctrina in Spanish and Tagalog and printed in the very year
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_15.jpg	1593. It would seem, therefore, that the book which the Governor had
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_16.jpg	allowed to be published was the Shih-lu, not the present Doctrina christiana
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_17.jpg	en letra y lengua china, a much slimmer volume bearing neither date nor
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_18.jpg	price.30
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_19.jpg	Before the Shih-lu was rediscovered (or in the absence of a proper
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_20.jpg	description) scholars have understandably regarded our Doctrina christiana
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_21.jpg	as the book licensed in 1593, and hence believed that it was printed in that
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_22.jpg	year if not some time before. In support of this opinion the following reasons
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_23.jpg	have been presented: the titlepage is in blockprint, whereas the works pub-
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_24.jpg	lished in the first decade of the seventeenth century have a titlepage set in
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_25.jpg	type; the printer Keng Yong must have been an infidel, in contrast with the
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_26.jpg	christened Chinese Juan and Pedro de Vera of the later publications; it was
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_27.jpg	printed in the Parián, not in Binondoc like those later books; its anonymity is
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_28.jpg	comparable to that of the earliest Doctrinas printed in America.31 It will be
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_29.jpg	observed that these arguments are inconclusive. The Parián continued to be
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_30.jpg	used after the expulsion of most of its residents in 1594; and the fact that a
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_31.jpg	non-Christian bookseller, called Zunhu, in 1606 had his shop there is sug-
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_32.jpg	gestive.32 The equipment needed for the cutting of blocks is very modest,
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_33.jpg	such as a private printer or bookscller could easily find anywhere, but natur-
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_34.jpg	ally he would not have any type at his disposal. Consequently, it is possible
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_35.jpg	that publication took place after 1593 and that the record of the licence to
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_36.jpg	print is lost.
en_Post-WW2_5_crop_37.jpg	A further comparison with the other two books, both firmly dated 1593,
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_0.jpg	THE MANILA INCUNABULA AND EARLY HOKKIEN STUDIES
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_2.jpg	numbered 1-337, each page measuring 14.5 by 10.3 cm and containing 24
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_3.jpg	lines. and a catchword. Five main parts can be distinguished:
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_4.jpg	is a Hokkien-Spanish dictionary, arranged under about two hundred and
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_5.jpg	fifty syllabic headings, each with a number of entries. There are at least
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_6.jpg	fifty more monosyllables in entries not corresponding to any of the headings.
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_7.jpg	A typical entry consists of a word in romanization, followed by remarks on
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_8.jpg	the tone and other features of pronunciation, the meaning in Spanish, and a
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_9.jpg	few phrases or compounds. Practically no Chinese characters are included;
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_10.jpg	in the few cases where a character is mentioned as figuring in the margin (35a,
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_11.jpg	44a, 159a) it is not there in the present manuscript. Diacritical marks are
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_12.jpg	mostly restricted to those for aspiration (a superscript h) and nasalization (a
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_13.jpg	swung dash), whereas the tones are vaguely described rather than marked by
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_14.jpg	a system of diacritics. Spelling mistakes are frequent, both in the romanized
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_15.jpg	"suegro" (212b), etc. Moreover, in many places words or whole sentences are
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_16.jpg	repeated by mistake or a passage is interrupted(e.g-on 1oa,98a,216b). Several
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_17.jpg	entries have been left without an appropriate heading, while some headings
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_18.jpg	are given twice. All this suggests that this "Bocabulario" was copied from an
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_19.jpg	earlier source. It is not even a complete copy, since several words to which
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_20.jpg	reference is made are not included. The dictionary records some dialect
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_21.jpg	variants within Hokkien, which will be discussed below.
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_22.jpg	225a-238a, "Lo que deve saver el ministro para administrar los sacramentos"
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_23.jpg	a manual consisting of five sections which deal with the administration of
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_24.jpg	the sacraments of baptism, eucharist, extreme unction, matrimony and
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_25.jpg	penance. Neither translation nor Chinese characters are present, but the
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_26.jpg	whole text is systematically provided with diacritical marks, including those
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_27.jpg	for the tones.
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_29.jpg	taining the romanized text and Spanish translation of the Doctrina christiana,
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_30.jpg	but no Chinese characters. The text is an almost verbatim transcription of
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_31.jpg	the edition as printed by Keng Yong and therefore a document of great
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_32.jpg	interest. The language is Hokkien throughout, even in the mysteries of the
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_33.jpg	rosary, where the printed edition only sparsely makes use of the special
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_34.jpg	Hokkien characters.17 However, the explanations of the fifteen individual
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_35.jpg	mysteries are left out, and only the invocations to Mary, which largely repeat
en_Post-WW2_6_crop_36.jpg	them, are transcribed. Diacritical marks are but occasionally supplied.18
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_0.jpg	PREFACE.
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_1.jpg	THE vernacular or spoken language of Amoy, which this Dictionary attempts to make more
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_2.jpg	Colloquial;" and it partially coincides with the so-called "Hok-kien Dialect," illustrated by
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_3.jpg	the Rev. Dr. Medhurst in his quarto Dictionary under that title. But such words as
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_4.jpg	"Dialect" or "Colloquial" give an erroneous conception of its nature. It is not a mere
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_5.jpg	pedantic phrases, but these are mere excrescences (and even they are pronounced according
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_6.jpg	to the Amoy sounds), while the main body and staple of the spoken language of the most
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_7.jpg	refined and learned classes is the same as that of coolies, labourers, and boatmen.
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_8.jpg	Nor does the term "dialect" convey anything like a correct idea of its distinctive
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_9.jpg	character; it is no mere dialectic variety of some other language; it is a distinct language,
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_10.jpg	one of the many and widely differing languages which divide among them the soil of China.
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_11.jpg	pronounced differently when read aloud in the different parts of China, so that while as
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_12.jpg	written it is one, as soon as it is pronounced it splits into several languages. And still
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_13.jpg	further, this written language, as it is read aloud from books, is not spoken in any place
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_14.jpg	whatever under any form of pronunciation. The most learned men never employ it as a
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_15.jpg	means of ordinary oral communication even among themselves. It is in fact a dead language,
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_16.jpg	related to the various spoken languages of China somewhat as Latin is to the languages of
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_17.jpg	South-western Europe.
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_18.jpg	A very considerable number of the spoken languages of China have been already more or
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_19.jpg	less studied by European and American residents in the country, such as the Mandarin, the
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_20.jpg	Hakka, the vernaculars of Canton and Amoy, and several others. These are not dialects of
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_21.jpg	one language; they are cognate languages, bearing to each other a relation similar to that
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_22.jpg	which subsists between the Arabic, the Hebrew, the Syriac, the Ethiopic, and the other
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_23.jpg	members of the Semitic family; or again between English, German, Dutch, Danish,
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_24.jpg	Swedish, &c.
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_25.jpg	There is another serious objection to the use of the term "dialect" as applied to these
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_26.jpg	languages, namely, that within each of them there exist real dialects. For instance, the
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_27.jpg	Mandarin, the greatest of all, contains within itself at least three very marked "dialects," the
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_28.jpg	Northern, spoken at Pekin; the Southern, spoken at Nanking and Soo-chow; and the
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_29.jpg	Western, spoken in the provinces of Sze-chuen, Hoo-peh, &c.
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_30.jpg	of Chang-chew, Chin-chew, Tung-an, and of Amoy itself. In this Dictionary the form of
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_31.jpg	the language spoken at Amoy itself is taken as the standard, and the principal variations of
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_32.jpg	the Chang-chew and Chin-chew dialecus are marked, as also a considerable number of the
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_33.jpg	variations occurring in Tung-an, Chang-poo, and some other regions.
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_34.jpg	The language of Amoy, including these ubordinate dialects, is believed to be spoken by
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_35.jpg	about eight or ten millions. This is the first dictionary of the spoken language. There are
en_Qing_Dynasty3_crop_36.jpg	numerous dictionaries of the universal written language of China. One of these, by the
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_1.jpg	PREFACE.
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_2.jpg	Sequel in two or three years, giving the characters so far as they can be found. Meantime,
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_3.jpg	while I greatly regret that the Chinese character does not appear in the book, I am in one
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_4.jpg	sense glad that it is absent. For it may serve to make manifest the fact that the Vernacular
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_5.jpg	of Amoy is an independent language, which is able to stand alone without the help of the
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_6.jpg	written character. And I should hope that many persons may thus be encouraged to study
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_7.jpg	this language who would have been repelled by the sight of the complicated and fantastic
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_8.jpg	characters. Of course every missionary, and every one who would be counted a seholar,
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_9.jpg	must study the written character too, for the Vernacular or Colloquial cannot for a very long
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_10.jpg	time to come possess any literature worthy of the name.
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_11.jpg	Another defect, which I greatly regret, is the very scanty identification of plants,
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_12.jpg	animals, medicines, &c. Want of time is here also the excuse, which I trust my readers will
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_13.jpg	count sufficient. Many such names have been put in with a query, being taken from
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_14.jpg	such works as The Fuh-chau Recorder, Notes and Queries on China and Japan, The Phoenix,
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_15.jpg	Dr.Porter Smith's Book on Medicines, the various dictionaries of the written language, &c,
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_16.jpg	while I had not the means of verifying them.
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_17.jpg	To some it seems also a great want that there is no English-Chinese part. But that
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_18.jpg	must really be a separate work. The whole style and character of Chinese thought and
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_19.jpg	a dictionary, which at first sight seems very easy, would really be enormous, falling not very
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_20.jpg	far short of the original composition.
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_21.jpg	With all its imperfections I trust that this book shall prove helpful to those who study
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_22.jpg	the language of Amoy. My chief object has been to assist those who are engaged in the
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_23.jpg	work of Christian missions; but for this purpose I have endeavoured to give a full view of
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_24.jpg	the language so far as I have been able to learn it; and the book is fitted to be equally
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_25.jpg	useful to merchants, travellers, mariners, interpreters, and students. It is most desirable
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_26.jpg	that foreigners residing among the Chinese should learn their language, so as to hold direct
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_27.jpg	intercourse with them, instead of using the miserable jargon called Canton-English or
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_28.jpg	"pigeon English," or being left at the mercy of interpreters. Few things would so much
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_29.jpg	tend to remove causes of dispute or bad feeling, and to make the intercourse between these
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_30.jpg	nations both pleasant and beneficial.
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_31.jpg	The explanations in the Introduction and Appendix have been much condensed from
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_32.jpg	want of time at the last; I have therefore not been able to give the several subjects a
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_33.jpg	scientific treatment, but have contented myself with such practical directions as will facilitate
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_34.jpg	the use of the book and the acquisition of the language.
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_35.jpg	In conclusion I would express my thanks to HUGH M.MATHESON, Esq., Convener of the
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_36.jpg	Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in England; to ROBERT BARBOUR,
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_37.jpg	Esq., of Bolesworth; and to C. E. LEwis, Esq., M.P., for the kind liberality which has
en_Qing_Dynasty4_crop_38.jpg	enabled me to publish the work.

en_Post-WW2_11_crop_1.jpg	THE MANILA INCUNABULA
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_2.jpg	AND EARLY HOKKIEN STUDIES
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_3.jpg	by P.VAN DER LOON
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_4.jpg	PART 1
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_5.jpg	Much has been written about the beginnings of printing in the
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_6.jpg	Philippines.1 Its history has presented some difficult problems, because few
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_7.jpg	of the earliest imprints have been preserved and not until recently have
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_8.jpg	scholars been able to lay their hands on copies of books published before
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_9.jpg	16o6. Descriptions of these incunabula are now available, but bibliographers
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_10.jpg	have to some extent been hampered in their work by unfamiliarity with
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_11.jpg	Chinese, the language in which several of the oldest surviving books are
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_12.jpg	written. I propose to give a survey of printing in Manila between 1593 and
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_13.jpg	16o7, basing myself on an analysis of the five imprints generally known and
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_14.jpg	adding a sixth, which I believe is here identified for the first time. Special
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_15.jpg	attention will be devoted to the date and authorship of one of these books.
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_16.jpg	which is important for the history of Hokkien vernacular and of which the
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_17.jpg	contents will be confronted with romanized texts found in a nearly con-
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_18.jpg	temporary manuscript.
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_19.jpg	The six books to be discussed were printed, under the auspices of
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_20.jpg	Dominican missionaries, by Chinese immigrants, the so-called Sangleys, who
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_21.jpg	not only introduced blockprinting but pioneered typography as well. Already
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_22.jpg	before the Spanish conquest of Manila in 1571 a Chinese community had
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_23.jpg	settled near Tondo, on the opposite bank of the Pasig river, in a place later
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_24.jpg	called Baybay. In 1581 the ministry of these Chinese was entrusted to the
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_25.jpg	order of Augustines, but it seems that after some years they neglected their
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_26.jpg	Sangley parishioners. In the meantime a place closer to the city had been set
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_27.jpg	aside as a market for the Chinese merchants. This market, or Parián, rapidly
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_28.jpg	attracted large numbers of traders and craftsmen. Most of the immigrants
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_29.jpg	had come from southern Fukien, where the main port of embarkation was
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_30.jpg	Hai-ch'eng. Even the events of October 16o3, culminating in the massacre
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_31.jpg	of the bulk of the Chinese population, some twenty thousand souls, only
en_Post-WW2_11_crop_32.jpg	temporarily stopped this inflow.2

en_Post-WW2_13_crop_0.jpg	P. VAN DER LOON
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_1.jpg	may have been a blockprint. It is immaterial where they were printed;
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_2.jpg	xylography could be practised with simple tools wherever a block-cutter was
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_3.jpg	at hand. Thus we can explain how the Augustinian friar Juan de Villanueva,
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_4.jpg	The Jesuit Pedro Chirino, reporting this, says that Villanueva and Blancas
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_5.jpg	were the first to print material in Tagalog.86 Chirino, Fernández, Nieva,
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_6.jpg	Aduarte: each gives his version of the origin of printing in the Philippines,
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_7.jpg	but only the last-named distinguishes (at least by implication) typography
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_8.jpg	from blockbooks; and none of them mentions the two works published in
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_9.jpg	1593 at the Dominican residence of San Gabriel.
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_10.jpg	Blockprinting was not only applied to books. On All Saints' Day 16o2,
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_11.jpg	pictures of the saints of the year, in the form of slips printed in the Jesuit
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_12.jpg	college, were distributed to the people of Manila.87 Were the missionaries
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_13.jpg	aware that the printing of paper gods for the new year was an old Chinese
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_14.jpg	custom? Some years later, a woodcut representing the Virgin and Child and
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_15.jpg	probably of Chinese craftsmanship was chosen to adorn the titlepage of the
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_16.jpg	twenty years, illustrated books and printed images disappear from the scene.
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_17.jpg	In the following table are listed all works known to have been printed
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_18.jpg	between 1593 and 16o7. Details include the title of each work (surviving
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_19.jpg	imprints in bold type), the language in which it was written, the author, the
en_Post-WW2_13_crop_20.jpg	place of publication with the name of the printer, and the date.

en_Post-WW2_14_crop_1.jpg	122
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_2.jpg	Which part of southern Fukien was the home of this dialect? No
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_3.jpg	linguistic survey of the area is available, but the more important differences
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_4.jpg	between the main dialects are well known. Historically these appear to be
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_5.jpg	connected with the limits of the administrative control exercised by the
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_6.jpg	ancient prefectures of Ch'uan-chou and Chang-chou (see sketchmap on
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_7.jpg	p.133 below). The two capitals were also cultural centres, and their dialects,
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_8.jpg	particularly that of Chuan-chou, enjoyed prestige which only declined
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_9.jpg	after the emergence of Amoy as a modern seaport. Though originally part of
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_10.jpg	Ch uan-chou, Amoy lies in the transition zone and its dialect is in several
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_11.jpg	respects intermediate between the other two.
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_12.jpg	The following table compares a number of words from the Doctrina
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_13.jpg	with their corresponding forms in the three modern Hokkien dialects and
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_14.jpg	the dialect of Ch'ao-an, the old prefectural city of Chaochow. The examples
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_15.jpg	for most of the finals could be increased, particularly if the material in the
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_16.jpg	"Bocabulario" were included ; it should, however, be noted that to one final
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_17.jpg	there is sometimes more than one correspondence, because the distinctions
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_18.jpg	in one dialect are fewer than in another. I am not concerned with the question
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_19.jpg	whether the Doctrina uses the "correct" character for a given Hokkien word,
en_Post-WW2_14_crop_20.jpg	nor do I include alternative pronunciations.

en_Post-WW2_15_crop_6.jpg	As a rule abbreviated characters are replaced by their full forms, but
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_7.jpg	characters adapted to Hokkien vernacular are retained. I also keep the
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_8.jpg	original punctuation marks, supplementing them where necessary (especi-
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_9.jpg	ally towards the end).
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_10.jpg	The two versions of the romanized text have been copied from the
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_11.jpg	manuscript in the British Museum (Add. 25 317). I retain the few scattered
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_12.jpg	tone marks, but replace the aspiration sign (a superscript h) by an inverted
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_13.jpg	comma. Where nasalization is indicated by means of a swung dash this
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_14.jpg	is preserved, but superscript n, which has the same function, is changed
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_15.jpg	The swung dash over syllabic m is also kept.In Spanish words, syllabic

en_Post-WW2_15_crop_17.jpg	abbreviations are expanded.
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_18.jpg	Notes refer to alterations in the original manuscript. They also offer
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_19.jpg	conjectured characters when the romanized text differs significantly from
en_Post-WW2_15_crop_20.jpg	the printed edition. Mistakes in the romanized text are not normally indica-

en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_2.jpg	The first becomes the third.
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_3.jpg	The second becomes the first.
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_4.jpg	The third becomes the second
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_5.jpg	The fourth becomes the eighth
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_6.jpg	The fifth becomes the third.
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_7.jpg	The seventh becomes the third.
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_8.jpg	The eighth becomes the fourth.
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_9.jpg	Great difficulty has been experienced throughout the entire
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_10.jpg	preparation of the book in getting Chinese characters which
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_11.jpg	would give the exact meaning of the various words and phrases
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_12.jpg	used in it. Many words being purely colloquial have no characters
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_13.jpg	of their own. To meet the difficulty, characters having the same
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_14.jpg	borrowed, and when this has not been found practicable, words of
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_15.jpg	a kindred meaning, though of different pronunciation, have been
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_16.jpg	adopted. Even these resources have not been found available in
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_17.jpg	all cases, and consequently many words have been left unrepresent-
en_Japanese_occupation3_crop_18.jpg	ed by any Chinese characters
